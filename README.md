# Overview
The Detailed Conceptual Model (DCM) is a series of documents showing entities, their relationships and relevant attributes of both for each model diagram. The entities and relationships are built on the High-Level Conceptual Model, with inputs from:
## EMu
This existing CMS solution at The Museum. We have taken a full data dictionary of the database and combined this with field usage statistics, to update the model and provide mappings from EMu to this DCLM. This helps us ensure we have full coverage of the existing CMS’s data requirements. The EMu data dictionary it split into modules, and this model will show which modules and field apply to which entities and attributes. The RECODE EMu DataDictionary Mappings list is the reference, showing the detailed mappings from EMu to the data model.
## Functional Requirements
Information based around stakeholder definitions of what the new CMS will need to provide. These documents are available to bidders and the DCM addresses each the User Story and Data Element and defines a modelling solution to support them. The DCM shows the outcome of this process, with the mappings in a separate document.
##External schemas and standards
The DCM will put its objects into context, showing where they reference external standards (e.g. SPECTRUM from the Collections Trust) and schemas (e.g. Darwin Code from the Biodiversity Information Standards). The DCM shows where its objects and attributes are analogous to the external ones and explains any differences and complexities.
## Results
These sources have led to:
Additions and changes to the entities and relationships from the H-LCM, as the requirements are more complex 
The additions of attributes and attribute groups to the entities and relationships 
The aim is to give readers a full representation of The Museum’s interpretation of its collection data model, showing how it links to the relevant concepts from a variety of sources. This should give suppliers enough information to assess how the Museum’s data model could be implemented in their proposed solution and be the starting point for detailed discussions in the latter stages of the procurement process.
